# Home Assistant Configuration

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration.  I started running Home Assistant in January 2023 on a RPi4 8GB with a 120GB SSD, but my smart home network expanded exponentially and I wanted to push the limits of my knowledge with a different setup. so in July 2023 I moved my Home Assistant instance into a Proxmox VE on a Lenovo M93p with an Intel i5 cpu running at 2.9MHz. I've got 16GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD. For anyone wondering, the move was pretty seamless and completed in a couple of hours.

I'll try to add content to the repository and this Readme when I can. Until then, feel free to browse and comment.
