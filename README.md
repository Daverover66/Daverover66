# Home Assistant Configuration

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration.  I started running Home Assistant in January 2023 on a RPi4 8GB with a 120GB SSD, but my smart home network expanded exponentially and I wanted to push the limits of my knowledge with a different setup. so in July 2023 I moved my Home Assistant instance into a Proxmox VE on a Lenovo M93p with an Intel i5 cpu running at 2.9MHz. It had 16GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD. 

However, I ran into some issue with the version of Proxmox I was running and the inability to run various Ttech Proxmox helper scripts to use the spare VE capacity it had. 

So, in February 2025 I moved my Home Assistant instance onto a Beelink S12 Pro.  The Beelink is an N100  processor running with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.  Home Assistant is now running bare metal HAOS with loads of spare capacity for future use.

For anyone wondering, every time I've moved my Home Assistant instance, the move has been straightforward and completed in a couple of hours.

The Lenovo M93p has now been freed up to reinstall a later version on Proxmox and use as a Frigate server for my cameras and a media server once I upgrade the SSD.

I'll try to add content to the repository and this Readme when I can. Until then, feel free to browse and comment.
